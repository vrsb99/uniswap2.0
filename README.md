## Introduction
UniSwap 2.0 is a Web 3 liquidity pool that exchanges a limited type of tokens. Namely, Wrapped Ether, VRSB Gold, VRSB Silver & VRSB Luna. The smart contract was creating using [Cranq](https://cranq.io) where a providerUrl, privateKey & account address would need to be added if the `uniswap_clone.cranqj` file was used. Tokens were created using a [token generator](https://www.smartcontracts.tools/token-generator/create/ethereum/)

### Created using React & Bootstrapped using [Create Eth App](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app)
